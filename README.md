build & install
---------------

Make sure you have the latest ncurses library and CMake 2.8 or higher.
```
$ cd fe-cli         # or whatever you named the root directory
$ cmake .
$ make
```

It works on Windows! Proof:

As stated before, you only require the latest ncurses library from Cygwin sources and Cmake 2.8 or higher. [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) comes with ncurses so you can just run ```pact install cmake``` and you're good to go.
