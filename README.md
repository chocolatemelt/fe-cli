fe-cli
------

FE:CLI puts the Fire Emblem tactical RPG gameplay in your terminal! The only controls are wasd and enter. Built for extensibility, flexibility, and faithfulness to the originals.
Read the docs for more information.

build & install
---------------

Make sure you have the latest ncurses library and CMake 2.8 or higher. I can't confirm whether or not this works on Cygwin for Windows.
```
$ cd fe-cli         # or whatever you named the root directory
$ cmake ../fe-cli   # see above
$ make
```
